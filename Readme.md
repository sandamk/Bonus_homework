Project title : SHELL creation.
Project Description:Created a script file called shell.c 
which when executed runs continuously, and display a prompt waiting for input. Shell only reads one line at a time from stdin. A command and all of its parameters may be deduced from this line. It then executes the command, which has been parsed and lexed. Fork/exec is used by the shell to generate a new process that matches the input. In this case, the shell just displays the prompt on the following line if a newline character is inserted without any additional text or white space after it is entered. Keyboard input and output to the terminal are both capabilities of the newly established process.
